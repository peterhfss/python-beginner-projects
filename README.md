# Python Beginner Projects

A repo with some projects in Python:

* <code>rock_paper_scissors</code>: a simple game in which I praticed using functions and if statements.
* <code>guess_the_number</code>: a simple game to guess the number, where I practiced using the random() module, functions, loops,and also conditionals.
